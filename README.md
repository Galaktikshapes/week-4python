## Code Overview

### `modify_and_save_file(input_filename, output_filename)`

* Reads content from `input_filename`, modifies it, and writes the modified content to `output_filename`.

### `read_file_with_error_handling()`

* Prompts for a filename, attempts to read it, and handles errors if the file is missing or unreadable.

## Usage

```python
input_file = "example.txt"  
output_file = "modified_example.txt"
modify_and_save_file(input_file, output_file)  # Modify and save

read_file_with_error_handling()  # Handle file reading errors
```

## Outcomes 

By the end of this module, you will:

* Master file operations and error handling in Python.
* Build more robust applications by handling file and IO-related errors gracefully.

### **How to Run**

1. Save the code to a Python file (e.g., `file_operations.py`).
2. Run it with:

   ```bash
   python file_operations.py
   ```
